# jackson-howard
A Discord BOT in development for my small **Android:Netrunner** Community

## GETTING STARTED 

## PREREQUISITES 

## TODO's
- draw function improvements
--- save a copy of the netrunnerdb json
--- role-exlcusive function to update the above json
--- accept & parse strings with spaces (i.e. parameter should contain both words of "Corporate Troubleshooter")
--- apply levenshtein distance and show exact match (i.e. "Sacrifice" should show the card url, but the response is ambiguos due to the Weyland Jemison ID card)

- prediction function with date and reminder (also maybe bets)

-complete writing this readme text
